Exercise 3: Switch Statement with Fallthrough

Problem:

Write a function `getShippingCost` that calculates shipping costs based 
on package weight. 

Use a switch statement with fallthrough to handle the following cases:

- For weights up to 1kg, the cost is $5.
- For weights above 1kg and up to 5kg, the cost is $10.
- For weights above 5kg and up to 10kg, the cost is $15.
- For weights above 10kg, the cost is $20.


Weights are categorized as:

1: up to 1kg
2: above 1kg up to 5kg
3: above 5kg up to 10kg
4: above 10kg

Implement the function so that it returns the 
correct shipping cost based on the weight category.
