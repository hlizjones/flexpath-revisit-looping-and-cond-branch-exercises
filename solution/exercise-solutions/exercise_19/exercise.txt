Exercise 19: Handling Complex Truthy/Falsy Conditions

Problem:

Write a function `normalizeInput` that accepts any value and returns:

- The value itself if it is truthy.
- A default value 'N/A' if the value is falsy but not null or undefined.
- hrows an error if the value is null or undefined.

Use conditional logic and strict equality operators to implement this.
