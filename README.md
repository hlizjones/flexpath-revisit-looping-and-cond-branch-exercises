### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Looping Constructs**:
    
    - **Classic For Loop**: Understanding initialization, condition, and iteration. Common pitfalls such as off-by-one errors.
    - **For-Of Loop**: Iterating over arrays and other iterable objects. Differences between `let` and `const` usage in loops.
    - **For-In Loop**: Iterating over object properties and understanding the nuances compared to `for-of`.
    - **While and Do-While Loops**: Usage and typical errors, like infinite loops and index mismanagement.
    - **ForEach Loop**: Using `forEach` on arrays and understanding how it handles sparse arrays differently from traditional loops.
2. **Advanced Iteration**:
    
    - **Handling Sparse Arrays**: Differences between regular loops and `forEach`.
    - **Using Functional Methods**: Methods like `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `find`, `some`, and `every` for array manipulation.
    - **Performance Considerations**: Best practices for optimizing loop performance and when to use break or early exit conditions.
3. **Branching Constructs**:
    
    - **If-Else Statements**: Proper usage with and without braces and common errors to avoid.
    - **Switch Statements**: Understanding fall-through behavior, best practices, and grouping case statements.
    - **Ternary Operator**: Writing concise conditional logic.
    - **Falsy and Truthy Values**: How JavaScript handles falsy and truthy values and common pitfalls.
4. **Nullish Coalescing**:
    
    - **Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)**: Simplifying checks for null or undefined values and using default values efficiently.
5. **Practical Applications**:
    
    - Scraping data from HTML elements using DOM methods.
    - Interacting with data structures like Maps, Sets, and HTMLCollections.
    - Error handling in loops and preventing infinite loops.
