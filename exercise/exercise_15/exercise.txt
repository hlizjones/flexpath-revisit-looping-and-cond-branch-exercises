Exercise 15: Advanced Use of Switch Statements

Problem:

Implement a function `evaluateOperation` that takes two numbers and 
a string representing an operator ('+', '-', '*', '/', '%', '^') and returns 
the result of applying that operator to the two numbers. 

Use a switch statement and ensure proper handling of invalid operators.
