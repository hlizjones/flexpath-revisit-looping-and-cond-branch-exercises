Exercise 17: Memory Management with Reference Types

Problem:

Demonstrate how copying objects in JavaScript affects memory references. 

Create an object `original` and a shallow copy `copy`. 

Modify a nested property in `copy` and show how it affects `original`. 

Then, create a deep copy to prevent this issue.
